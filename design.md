## Design
The lord_of_the_rings module provides a simple Python wrapper for The One API, a RESTful web service that provides data about The Lord of the Rings universe.

## Architecture
The module consists of a single class, LordOfTheRings, which represents the wrapper for The One API. The class has three methods, `movies_list()`, `movie(movie_id)`, and `movie_quotes(movie_id)`, which correspond to the three endpoints of The One API that this module currently supports.

The `_request()` method is a helper method that handles the actual HTTP requests to the API. The method takes a number of optional parameters, including a path argument representing the endpoint, and optional `limit`, `page`, `offset`, `sort`, and `filters` (`list` and `str` ways supported) parameters. 

## Usage
To use the lord_of_the_rings module, users should import the `LordOfTheRings` class and create a new instance with your **access token**. They can then call the relevant API methods to retrieve data.

## Error handling
If an error occurs while making a request to the API, the `_request()` method will raise a `requests.exceptions.RequestException`.

## Future improvements
As the project grows, additional endpoints could be added to the LordOfTheRings class to support more API functionality. Additionally, the module could be extended to provide additional data processing or analysis functionality for The Lord of the Rings universe.

Also `movie_quotes(movie_id)` method returns an empty response if the provided `movie_id` is not part of the LotR main Trilogy. Which is not user-friendly. To improve the user experience, we can add a check to ensure that the movie_id belongs to the main trilogy ids.
